						Ada Rose from FTLabs, i’m here to talk today about animation performance.
    					There is much more to say than can fit into a 5 minute talk so I will rush over a few good concepts needed for good performance. I will avoid going into details on the render pipeline for excellent coverage of that watch some talks by Paul Lewis.

* Jank is when the frame takes longer to layout and render than 16ms. Causes a stutter it feels bad.
* Caused by slow synchronous events
* e.g. XHR, big localstorage uses but most commonly...
* Page layouts and paints
--------
* Layout is slowest
* Making a small DOM change could potentially invalidate the entire DOM tree causing it to be recalculated
* An invalidated DOM is recalculated each frame and whenever a layout property is read
--------
* Paint is medium slow
* This is where the layer's bitmap has been invalidated and needs to be redrawn and stored in memory
* This is done on each render
--------
* Composite is very fast
* Composite only involves the graphics card rerendering from bitmaps calculated in paint

* Two commonly seen mistakes
* The First is Reading then writing in a loop which thrashes the DOM becasue the layout is invalidated and recalculated on every single read.
* The second is animating properties which cause layouts on the DOM this slide is making my fan spin up and makes a phone cry and this has a relatively simple DOM structure. On this slide the layout is recalculated every single frame.
-----------
* The fix for the first situation tends to be fairly simple batch your reads and write all together. Don't change a property then immediately read it. Don't append to an `innerhtml` in a loop add it to a seperate string and update it in one go.
* Wilson Page's fastdom library can help with this in an mvc or a large framework with many independent modules so that reads and writes in a single frame all get done together.
* A good general motto is to calculate all DOM changes first then apply them in a single step.
-----------
* This still leaves us with the second issue, how do you animate something which changes the layout?
* One very common use case is a list widget which grows as an element is added.
* This can affect the whole dom so would be very expensive to animate.

* Let's say we have an app like so
* and we want to animate prepending an element to the start,
* here we have an issue because as you can see heights change and many elements move,
* so just animating the height change is not an issue since the entire document will need to get relaid out.
* but following on from earlier before we insert the new notification we can measure how everything will change
* then animate the change.
* when doing something like this it is best to front load all of the dom read/writes so the app is responsive as the animation finishes.
* if it is a dom change on a button click then you have about a whole 100ms to measure and write to the DOM before it feels sluggish.
* (? perhaps also take this time to perform a prefetch)
* this method follows up from a great talk given by paul lewis at the chrome dev summit
-------
Follow it through in detail
* Measure everything we want to measure.
* store the current animation so it can be restored later set it to ‘0s’
* store the current transform so it can be restored later
* Perform the function
* Measure the new positions, sizes,
* Anything which has changed size: scale it and all give all of its children the inverse transform.
* * Give all the children the offset of the top left of the parent
* * Give them the inverse scale
* apply the translations to move everything to its new place
* apply the new transition to everything affected
* set all of the transforms to their original values
* watch everything smoothly animate.
* on transitionend
* * restore the transitions
* * fire any callbacks

* It is possible to alter the layout on a simple widget and not have the whole dom affected.
* There is a draft css spec called containment which will hint to the browser in much the same way as the will-change property that this element will not affect the rest of the DOM tree.
* It requires cerain properties such as no scrolling and fixed dimensions.
* It could be done in browsers previouly but it relied on the element having certain properties before it would have layout boundaries such as a fixed height and no scroll, the containment spec still requires these properties but makes it clear what is happening which is good.
