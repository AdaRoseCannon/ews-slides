* Jank is when the frame takes longer to layout and render than 16ms to hit fps. Causes a stutter it feels bad.
* Shows up in the timeline as very tall bars
* Caused by slow synchronous eventsmost commonly Layouts and Paints
--------
* Layout is slowest
* Making a small DOM change could potentially invalidate the entire DOM tree causing it to be recalculated
* An invalidated DOM is recalculated whenever a layout property is read and each rendered frame
--------
* Paint is medium slow
* This is where the layer's bitmap has been invalidated and needs to be redrawn and stored in memory
* This is done on each render
--------
* Composite is very fast
* Composite only involves the graphics card rerendering from bitmaps calculated in paint
--------
* (CSS triggers is a great resource it lists whether a change involves Just composite, paint and composite or layout paint and composite.)

* Writing to DOM is free, you can write as much as you want
* Once the DOM is read if it has been invalidated it needs to be recalculated which is expensive
* One common problem is reading then writing in a loop which thrashes the DOM; the layout is invalidated and recalculated on every single read.
* Which could mean multiple layout operations per frame
* The second is animating properties which cause layouts on the DOM. Even for this simple layout having to recalculate the layout every frame is making my laptop's fan spin up.
-----------
* The fix for the first situation tends to be fairly simple: batch your reads and write all together. Don't change a property then immediately read it.
* E.g.Don't append to an `innerhtml` in a loop INSTEAD add it to a seperate string and update the `innerHTML` in one go.
### Fastdom slide
* In an mvc or a large framework with many independent modules it can be difficult to ensure modules do not interleave read and writes Wilson Page's fastdom library can help with this so that reads and writes in a single frame all get done together.
* A good general motto is to calculate all DOM changes first then apply them in a single step.

* Let's say we have an app like so
* and we want to animate prepending an element to the start,
* here we have an issue because as you can see height changes which pushes many elements around the page because of this change,
* so it's expensive because it's a layout operation and much worse because the whole page will change
* but following on from earlier before we insert the new notification we can measure how everything will change
* then animate the change.
* when doing something like this it is best to front load all of the dom read/writes so the app is responsive as the animation finishes.
* if it is a dom change on a button click then you have about a whole 100ms to measure and write to the DOM before it feels sluggish.
* (? perhaps also take this time to perform a prefetch)
* this method follows up from a great talk given by paul lewis at the chrome dev summit
-------
Follow it through in detail
* Measure everything we want to measure.
* store the current animation so it can be restored later set it to ‘0s’
* store the current transform so it can be restored later
* Perform the function
* Measure the new positions, sizes,
* Anything which has changed size: scale it and all give all of its children the inverse transform.
* * Give all the children the offset of the top left of the parent
* * Give them the inverse scale
* apply the translations to move everything to its new place
* apply the new transition to everything affected
* set all of the transforms to their original values
* watch everything smoothly animate.
* on transitionend
* * restore the transitions
* * fire any callbacks

* Even though this modal looks isolated the browser may still relayout the whole Dom
* but we can seperate it's DOM invalidation from the rest of the page
* Doing so doesn't accelerate the animation but it does make the layout change less catastophic.
----------
* There is a draft css spec called containment which will hint to the browser in much the same way as the will-change property that this element will not affect the rest of the DOM tree.
* It requires cerain properties such as no scrolling and fixed dimensions.
* It could be done in browsers previouly but it relied on the element having certain properties before it would have layout boundaries such as a fixed height and no scroll, the containment spec still requires these properties but makes it clear what is happening which is good.
